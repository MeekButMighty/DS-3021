# Oliver's Case Study

## Read through the case study and then discuss the problem as a group then address these questions below:

### What problems are facing the organization?
Billions of dollars are wasted annually in the U.S. education system on software that fails to meet the unique needs, skills, and contexts of individual schools within districts. They want to save as much money as possible, but also deploy effective tools that help kids learn.

### What is the target variable and what type (reg or class) of solution are they developing?
The target variable is the software used (or recommended) in a given school district.

### How would they know the solution was working (business metric)?
Test scores, teacher feedback, student feedback, and accuracy of recommendations.

### What other issues might the team be facing?
The team might simply not have enough data to train the model. Even the data they already have is only from the midwest, which isn't necessarily representative of everyone and result in biased conclusions

## Work through the following Data to Concept and Learning:

### How difficult is the data to gather?
From the synopsis, data is pretty difficult to gather because they don't have that many survey responses. It requires reaching out to a large amount of school districts, and convincing people to spend time taking a survey can be challenging
### Is the target difficult to measure or break into smaller parts?
The target is relatively abstract, but could definitely be broken into smaller parts. Maybe there are different levels of software or different pieces that can be used together or separately.
### What level of uncertainty (risk) are you willing to accept?
The biggest risk in this scenario is wasting more money. I'd want to make sure the model wasn't suggesting overly expensive products. Letting the model make final decisions would be too risky
