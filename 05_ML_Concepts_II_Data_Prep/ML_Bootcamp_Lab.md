Goal: Build two data prep pipelines using different datasets to get practice with data preparation and question building.
  
Step one: Review these two datasets and brainstorm problems that could be addressed with the dataset. Identify a question for each dataset. 

[College Completion Data Dictionary](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/boost-student-success-with-college-completion-da/data)

[College Completion Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UVADS/DS-3021/refs/heads/main/data/cc_institution_details.csv)

  - Dataset is in the data file in the DS 3021 repo, but was added after class started so you may need to "git pull" to get it.

[Job_Placement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DG1606/CMS-R-2020/master/Placement_Data_Full_Class.csv) 

 - [Data Dictionary (kinda) for Job Placement](https://www.kaggle.com/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement/discussion/280612) - You'll need to infer from the column names but also the comments on the site.

Step two: Work through the steps outlined in the examples to include the following elements: 

  * What is a independent Business Metric for your problem? Feel free to be creative.
  * Data preparation:  
    * correct variable type/class as needed
    * collapse factor levels as needed
    * one-hot encoding factor variables 
    * normalize the continuous variables
    * drop unneeded variables
    * create target variable if needed...this will depend on your question
  * Calculate the prevalence of the target variable...depending on question again  
  * Create the necessary data partitions (Train,Tune,Test)
  * Build both your pipelines into a function and test that the results match your expectations.
  
Step three: What do your instincts tell you about the data. Can it address your problem, what areas/items are you worried about?
